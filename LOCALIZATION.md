# This is the official [TFA SWEP Base](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2840031720) English localization file reference.

### The base currently supports these languages officially:
- English
- Russian
- French (slightly outdated)

## If you want to make a localization pack for the base, you need to follow these steps:
1. Make sure the [language is supported by the game](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Addon_Localization#supportedlanguages)
1. Download the [localization reference file](resource/localization/en/tfa_base.properties)
1. Put the file into `<your new addon folder>/resource/localization/<language code>` folder
1. Translate the lines. Please make sure to remove the untouched/unlocalized lines to allow proper English fallback in case of any changes.
1. Your localization pack is ready to use and for uploading to Steam Workshop! It will work __on any server__ since this localization is only needed on the client.
